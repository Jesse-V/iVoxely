# iVoxely

This is voxel-based game in C++11 and OpenGL. At the moment, the rendering and game engines are still being built, but since iVoxely is under active development, implementation of the game itself will be coming soon.

### System requirements

1. OpenGL 3.0
2. The GLEW, Freeglut, and GLM libraries.
3. The Linux operating system. Either Mint or *buntu. Possibly Debian.

GLEW and Freeglut are used to create the window. OpenGL powers the rendering, and the GLM library performs linear-algebra operations CPU-side.

### Installation

Currently the only way to install iVoxely is to compile it. Luckily, this is pretty easy, especially in Linux. The main trick it to ensure that the necessary components are installed beforehand, otherwise there will be errors during the compilation process. Thankfully, installing these libraries is very straightforward with the following command:

**sudo apt-get install libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libglm-dev cmake build-essential**

Then it should be ready to compile. I support two compilers: Clang and GCC. I prefer the former because it compiles faster, seems more intelligent, has better diagnostic messages, and [for other reasons](http://clang.llvm.org/comparison.html). I have shell scripts set up in the _src_ directory that make it easy to compile and run the project. To run them or to compile manually, navigate into the _src_ directory, and run either **./ClangCompileRun** to use Clang, or run **./compileRun** for GCC. It should compile and run.

I personally compile this code using Clang in Linux Mint 14, which inherits Quantal's (12.10) packages. I'm running the nightly developer's build of Clang 3.4, which you too can get by running:

* *sudo echo "deb http://llvm.org/apt/quantal/ llvm-toolchain-quantal main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list*
* *sudo apt-get update*
* *sudo apt-get clang-3.4*

I may switch to Clang 3.3 once I can find a build for Quantal.

### Development

There are three main branches:

1. The _master_ branch is the stable development edition. The version at the end (not in the middle) of this branch will compile and run generally as intended, though it may have bugs and features may not be in their final state. This is basically a working snapshot of the project.
2. The _packaging_ branch is the stable edition. The master branch will merge into this when particular milestones and sets of features have been finished off and generally smoothed out. These builds will be available for installation through [my Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~jvictors), though this is not available at the moment.
3. The _*-dev_ branches are unstable development. These are cutting-edge development, and builds here are not guaranteed to compile or even work. I'll pull from master, develop a feature or fix something, and then merge my JesseV-dev branch with master when I finish.

The *CMakeClean.sh* script in the _src_ directory is useful for cleaning out the files generated by building and compiling the code. Since the build and compiling is dependent on the working directory and environment, it makes sense to clean the build before pushing to Github.

### Origin

This project is based on the framework developed in the [CS5400 Final Project repo](https://github.com/Jesse-V/CS5400_Final_Project repo) from which [https://github.com/Jesse-V/OpenGL_Texture_Mapping](my OpenGL Texture Mapping project) was based.
